# Bill of Material
- 3x TC4420 Mosfet Driver IC's
- 3x IRLZ44N(or IRFZ44N) Mosfets
- 4x 0.1uF Ceramic disk capacitors
- 5x 10uF Electrolytic capacitors
- 1x Female pin header bar(single row)
- 1x Male pin header bar (single row)
- 1x 7805 Regulator
- 1x 2 pin screw terminal (3.5mm pin spacing/1mm size)
- 1x ESP8266 Module
Optional
- 1x Heatsink for the 7805
- 3x Heatsinks for the MOSFET ( depending on the power of your yout LED's) 

# Observations
I ran this circuit for years for a reasonable amount of time without the heatsink on 7805, it gets hot to touch but it never failed.
With my RGB led strip(that is about 5 meters long) the mosfet aren't hot to touch at all, but your experience may me different.
