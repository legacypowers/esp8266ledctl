# esp8266ledctl
Common Cathode ESP8266 LED Strip controller 
Those cheap LED controllers with IR remote didn't satisfied me, so i started to code this project with an Android, Windows and Linux(CLI) tool
Currently the code for the ESP8266 have hardcoded wifi settings, but i plan to add an option to configure it over USB.
The hardware is built with a 3x TC4420 mosfet drivers and 3x IRFZ44N n-channel mosfet.
